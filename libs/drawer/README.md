## Why

This package provides a straightforward, dynamic approach to incorporating drawers in Angular applications, enhancing user interface and experience through minimal coding and flexible interaction patterns between parent and child components.

## Getting Started

### Installation

1. Install @ng-vibe/drawer locally:

   ```bash
   npm install @ng-vibe/drawer
   ```

2. Incorporate `@ng-vibe/drawer` into your Angular module providers by importing `provideNgVibeDrawer`:

   ```typescript
   import { provideNgVibeDrawer } from '@ng-vibe/drawer';
   ...
   providers: [
     ...,
     provideNgVibeDrawer(),
   ],
   ```

3. Add the `@ng-vibe/drawer` styles to your application, either in the `angular.json`:

   ```json
   "styles": [
     "./node_modules/@ng-vibe/drawer/styles/styles.css",
     ...
   ],
   ```

   Or directly in your `styles.scss`:

   ```scss
   @import '@ng-vibe/drawer/styles/styles';
   ```

### Usage

To use `@ng-vibe/drawer` in your Angular app:

```javascript
import {DrawerRemoteControl, DrawerPosition} from '@ng-vibe/drawer';

export class AppComponent {
   private drawer: DrawerRemoteControl = DrawerRemoteControl(DialogDummyComponent);

   openDrawer(optionalPayload) {
      this.drawer.options = {
         position: DrawerPosition.RIGHT, // Options: LEFT, RIGHT, TOP, BOTTOM
         showOverlay: true,
      };
      this.drawer.openDrawer(optionalPayload).subscribe((resp) => {
         console.log('Response from child component:', resp);
      });
   }

   closeDrawer() {
      this.drawer.closeDrawer();
   }
}
```

#### Enhanced Drawer Interaction with Loader

Integrate a loading mechanism into the drawer with optional Angular component for loader customization:

```javascript
import { DrawerRemoteControl, inject } from '@ng-vibe/drawer';

export class DummyComponent {
  drawerRemoteControl: DrawerRemoteControl = inject(DrawerRemoteControl);

   openDrawer() {
    this.drawerRemoteControl.withLoader();
    //this.drawerRemoteControl.withLoader(MyCustomLoaderComponent); // Optional custom loader
    this.drawerRemoteControl.openDrawer()
    
     // simulates async code
     setTimeout(() => {
         // Can be called directly from the child component
        this.drawerRemoteControl.stopLoader(); // Call this to stop the loader and reveal the content
     }, 2000);
  }

  closeDrawer() {
    this.drawerRemoteControl.closeDrawer();
  }
}
```

### Configuration Options

`@ng-vibe/drawer` provides a set of configurable options to customize the drawer behavior:

```typescript
export interface IDrawerOptions {
  width: string;
  height: string;
  position: DrawerPosition;
  showOverlay: boolean;
}
```
### Configuration Options

`@ng-vibe/drawer` provides a set of configurable options to customize the drawer behavior:

| Option        | Description                            | Type                  |
|---------------|----------------------------------------|-----------------------|
| width         | The width of the drawer.               | `string`              |
| height        | The height of the drawer.              | `string`              |

| showOverlay   | Whether to show an overlay.            | `boolean`             |


### Advanced Drawer Management

`@ng-vibe/drawer` includes a `DrawerService` for advanced management of drawer states, offering methods for querying active drawers, obtaining drawer controls, and programmatically closing all drawers:

```typescript
class DrawerService {
  /**
   * An Observable that emits the count of active drawers by listening to state changes,
   * calculating the total number of active drawers.
   */
  public activeDrawersCount$: Observable<number>;

  /**
   * Retrieves the RemoteControl object associated with a specific drawer ID.
   * @param {string} id The unique identifier for the drawer.
   * @returns {DrawerRemoteControl | undefined} The RemoteControl object, if found.
   */
  public getRemoteControl(id: string): DrawerRemoteControl | undefined;

  /**
   * Returns an Observable that emits the RemoteControl object for a given drawer ID,
   * filtering out undefined states.
   * @param {string} id The unique identifier for the drawer.
   * @returns {Observable<DrawerRemoteControl | undefined>} An Observable emitting the RemoteControl object.
   */
  public selectRemoteControl$(id: string): Observable<DrawerRemoteControl | undefined>;

  /**
   * Closes all active drawers.
   */
  public closeAll(): void;
}
```
